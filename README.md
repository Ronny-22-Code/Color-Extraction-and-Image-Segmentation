# Image-Segmentation
This repository introduces to my personal project, which explains and demonstrates the concept of segmentation of feature vectors according to the "Dominant Characteristic Feature" persistent in the image. The demonstration of the project was achieved by the application of "K-Means" Clustering algorithm, which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm typically used for vector quantization and signal processing with data mining. This algorithm follows an iterative approach to segment or partition the dataset effectively, into K pre-defined clusters or overlapping sub-groups. The output obtained is the dominant color schemes demonstrated through graphical representation persistent in the image given as input.
